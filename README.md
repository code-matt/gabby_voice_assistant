# v0.2

Interesting parts so far are:

-gabby_ios_rubymotion_client/app/models/apiAIvoiceController.rb
-gabby_ios_rubymotion_client/app/screens/home_screen.rb
-gabby_ios_rubymotion_client/app/stylesheets/home_screen_stylesheet.rb

I have plans to expand this with IBM watson image recognition as well
as knowledge. The idea is that a user logs in and over time as they as questions
and tell gabby things, it builds a database that is personalized to them. Also
started experimenting with personalized actions.. right now Gabby can click
a mouse lol.
